        <p>The Beacon House's long term residential program focuses on the underlying causes of addiction and alcoholism. After 50 years of experience, we have consistently demonstrated that peer driven treatment, a healthy community, along with work force development provides a successful model for recovery.
             Our long-term approach allows residents to leave the program with a foundation for sustainable sobriety, so they can enjoy a meaningful, and purpose driven life.</p>
