              <div><p> I started this class with very little understanding of web development. In 2020, I caught covid and I was forced to stay home. During that time, I decided
                to learn how to build websites. The links above represent some of the projects I worked on. Obviously they look much better then this site, this is because I unrestricted
              a front-end web builder - divi and elementor. From there, I wanted to learn more about coding. It was suggested that I start with a basic HTML and CSS course - so here I am! I took this class
            because I wanted to at least start a foundation and grow my understanding. I feel like I accomplished that. Coding and this form of work seemed really scary to me, but thanks to this class, I feel like
          I could learn these skills if I devote the time! </p>
        </div>
              <div><p>I would like to learn/practice HTML and CSS more so I can grow my understanding. Once I feel confident in my abilities, I would like to learn more about Javascript. 
                I can also see myself learning more about different programming languages. Lastly, I would love to learn more about databases and learn how to build web applications.
